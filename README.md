# Customer Churn Predictor 

## Problem Statement -
In the highly competitive banking industry, customer retention is critical for sustained business growth. A significant challenge that banks face is predicting customer churnâ€”when a customer decides to close their account or stop using a bank's services. Early detection of potential churn can allow the bank to take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.

This project aims to build a predictive system to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical banking data. The model utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture, developed using Keras and TensorFlow, to make accurate predictions of customer churn.

The system is deployed using Streamlit, enabling a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
